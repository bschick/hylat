# Each line is a group of people who you want to be on different teams if possible. Each line
# could be a family or any group of people who you want on different teams. Within each line
# there are one or more categories of people, like parents and kids, that this tool can either
# spread out on different teams or keep together depending the selected options. Categories
# are separated by a colon and people within categories are comma seperated lists.
#
# Using the family example, to have families end up on different teams with parents and kids
# spread out evenly across teams, each line would have one family with kids as the first
# category and parents as the second. An example line with one kid and two parents
#   Weston Peters : Ava Peters, Eric Peters
#
# The categories on each line can be empty. An example line with parents but no kids
#   : Jack Manning, Kelly Manning
#
# You may leave out the : separator as a shortcut way to make each person on a line part of
# the first category. An example line with only kids
#   Samantha Peake, Sister Peake
#
# Rather than famlies with parents and kids, you can use whatever categories you have.
# For example, each line could be a school class with "TeacherList: StudentList". You can
# also not use categories at all or have more than two. Team Generator will always try to
# put the people on each line onto different teams and then either spread out people in the
# same category or group them together based on the options you select.
