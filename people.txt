# Each line is a group of people who you want to be on different teams if possible. Each line
# could be a family or any group of people who you want on different teams. Within each line
# there are two categories of people, like parents and kids that this tool can either spread
# out on different teams or put together.
#
# The format of each line is
#   ParentList : KidList
#
# Where ParentList and KidList are comma seperated names. For example, a family line with
# two parents and one kid would be
#   Ava Peters, Eric Peters : Weston Peters
#
# The ParentList or KidList on each line can be empty. An example with parents but no kids
#   Jack Manning, Kelly Manning :
#
# You may leave out the : seperator as a shortcut way to make each person on a line part of
# the KidList (the second category). An example with only kids
#   Samantha Peake, Sister Peake
#
# Rather than famlies with parents and kids, you can use whatever categories you have.
# For example, each line could be a school class with "TeacherList: StudentList" or have just
# one category of people. Team Generator will always try to seperate the people on each line
# into different teams.
