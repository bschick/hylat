# Enter one family per line with a format of:
#   ParentList : KidList 
#
# Where ParentList and KidList are comma seperated names. For example, a family line could be:
#   Ava Peters, Eric Peters : Weston Peters
#
# The ParentList or KidList on each line can be empty, but the line must still have a : separator.
# An example with kids but no parents:
#   : Samantha Peake, Sister Peake
#
# Rather than "parents" and "kids", you can use whatever categories you want. For example, each
# line could be a school class including "Teachers: Students" that you want on different teams
#
# Example families list below (names from https://homepage.net/name_generator/)
