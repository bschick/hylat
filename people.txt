# Create teams from a list of people. This tool was originally built to make teams from
# families attending a school ping-pong tournament, but can be used to make teams from
# any set of people. The simplest way to use this tool is to enter one person per line
# and Team Generator will create random teams based on the options you select.
#
# Sometimes you may want more control over team creation. In particular, it is common to
# want certain people to be on different teams. With this tool you can controll that by
# putting those people on the same line separated by commas. Team generator will ensure
# people on the same line are put on different teams. For example, each line could 
# represent a family whose members you want on different teams.
#
# You can go further by adding one or more categories to each line. Categories are
# created using colon separators, and allow you to control how people in those
# categories are distributed across teams. For example, each family line could have
# categories for kids and for parents that the tool will evenly distribute accoss teams
# to avoid teams of all parents or kids.
#
# Using the family example, here are are a few lines with four people. Since Samantha and
# Sister are on the same line they will be put on different teams.
#    Samantha Peake, Sister Peake
#    Luke
#    James Freeman
#
# The next example adds categoriues with the use of a colon separator. Categories are
# used to distinguish between kids (before the colon) and parents (after the colon) on
# each line. People on a single line are still put on different teams and categories are
# used to evenly distribute people of the same category across teams.

# The categories on each line can be empty. The first line below has no kids and two
# parents while the second line has one kid and one parent.

#
# Rather than famlies with parents and kids, you can use whatever categories you have.
# For example, each line could be a school class with "TeacherList: StudentList". You can
# also not add any categories or use more than two. Team Generator will always try to
# put the people on each line onto different teams and then either spread out people in
# the same category or group them together based on the options you select.
