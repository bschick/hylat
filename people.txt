# One family per line with a format of:
#   parent [, parent] : kid [, kid]
# Parent or kid list can be empty (both could be empty, but why?)
# # as first character means the line is ignored
#
# Instead of "parents" and "kids", you can use whatever categories
# you want. For example, each line could be a school class including
# "Teachers: Students" or ":Students" that you want on different teams
